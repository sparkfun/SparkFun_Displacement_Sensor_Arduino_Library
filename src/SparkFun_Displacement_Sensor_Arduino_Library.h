/*
  This is an Arduino library written for the Bend Labs One Axis
  and Two Axis Angular Displacement Sensor (ADS).
  By Nathan Seidle @ SparkFun Electronics, March 2nd, 2019

  The command set and a smattering of functions were taken from the HAL written by BendLabs.

  If you are using a different platform than Arduino or want a more advanced
  interface checkout the Hardware Abstraction Layer they provide.

  The Bend Labs Sensors are very precise, very flexible, flex sensors
  providing their angle of flex with two decimals of accuracy and
  an update rate up to 500Hz.

  SparkFun labored with love to create this code. Feel like supporting open
  source? Buy a product from SparkFun!

  Note: While it is possible to disable the X axis or the Y axis on the
  dual-axis sensor, this library does not support it.
